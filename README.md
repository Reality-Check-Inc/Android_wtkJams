## wtkJams - Full Description

wtkJams can be used to connect to any Karaoke venue that uses the kJams software.  You can use wtkJams to search for songs by Artist or Title, add yourself to the rotation, change pitch & tempo of songs, maintain a list of your favorite songs, view your song history, and view the current rotation, all from your 5.0+ Android device.

When you log into a public venue, we track the location (if you allow it) so that we can show other wtkJams and Where's the Karaoke? ™ users the locations of Karaoke events.

When you search for a song, add or remove a song from Tonight or Favorites, we track that information so that we can show other wtkJams and Where's the Karaoke? ™ users what songs are currently hot. The information may also be used to describe a venue as to the type of music that is commonly requested there.

In the unfortunate event of a crash, the information is sent to us so that we can analyze, and hopefully quickly resolve the issue with an update.
